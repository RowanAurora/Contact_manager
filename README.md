Design Choices
- Implemented a button-based filter for contact tags. Will only maintain tags that are in-use.
- If there are no tags associated with a contact, tags will not display on thier card.
  
- Name search only searches starting at the start of names.

- Decided against highlighting buttons that are hovered over. Might change this.
- Name validation is very basic, just alphabetic characters with space and -
- Phone validation is permissive on some formatting

- Color contrast with texts-backgrounds is 4.58:1, ADA complaint except for very small text.
